                  Iâ€™m a passionate full-stack software engineer.
                  Building projects with purpose drives me.
                  Iâ€™m a fast learner and a doer who is not afraid of quickly bootstrapping code to embrace changes.
                  Rigor is my leitmotiv: if my code is not tested, then itâ€™s not ready.
                  If it is not documented, then itâ€™s not ready.
                  Iâ€™m ready for my next challenge. ðŸš€

                  We built the future of recruiting on social networks.
                  I worked 5 years as a full-time employee and as my experience grew,
                  I took more responsibilities, reaching the role of lead software architect.
                  I crafted and supervised a web stack serving 1M monthly active users.
                  I collaborated with and mentored a team of 5+ engineers,
                  while closely brainstorming and building user experiences with the product team.

                  We created a blockchain-based insurance product with the very early-stage Ethereum technology.
                  I was responsible for the product elaboration and the engineering conception.
                  Building a product on top of Ethereum was very interesting and challenging.
                  The project ended because of different life trajectories
                  (my co-founder wanted to go back to Europe).

                  I also take part in a lot of founder-specific tasks such as user acquisition and retention.
