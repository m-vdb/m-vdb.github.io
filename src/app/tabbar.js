              Iâ€™m a passionate full-stack software engineer.
              Building projects with purpose drives me.
              Iâ€™m a fast learner and a doer who is not afraid of quickly bootstrapping code to embrace changes.
              Rigor is my leitmotiv: if my code is not tested, then itâ€™s not ready.
              If it is not documented, then itâ€™s not ready.
              Iâ€™m ready for my next challenge. <span role="img" aria-label="Rocket">ðŸš€</span>

              We built the future of recruiting on social networks.
              I worked 5 years as a full-time employee and as my experience grew,
              I took more responsibilities, reaching the role of lead software architect.
              I crafted and supervised a web stack serving 1M monthly active users.
              I collaborated with and mentored a team of 5+ engineers,
              while closely brainstorming and building user experiences with the product team.

              We created a blockchain-based insurance product with the very early-stage Ethereum technology.
              I was responsible for the product elaboration and the engineering conception.
              Building a product on top of Ethereum was very interesting and challenging.
              The project ended because of different life trajectories
              (my co-founder wanted to go back to Europe).
